Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate image recognition using IBM Cloud's Visual Recognition service and generating captions for recognized images using AI-based natural language generation. The website provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images while displaying generated captions.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
An IBM Cloud account with Visual Recognition and AI services set up
API credentials for IBM Cloud services
Installation
Clone the project repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ibm-cloud-image-recognition.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd ibm-cloud-image-recognition

Install project dependencies: npm install

Configure your IBM Cloud API credentials and other environment variables in a .env file. Ensure you protect this file and never share your API credentials publicly: IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key IBM_CLOUD_API_URL=your_api_url

Start the application: npm start

Navigating the Website Access the website by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 or the appropriate URL where the project is deployed. Use the image upload feature to select and upload an image for classification. Click the "Recognize Image" button to trigger the image recognition process. Once the image is recognized, the recognized image will be displayed along with a generated caption.

Updating Content To update content on the website: Modify HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed. These files are located in the project directory. Update any text content or captions directly in the HTML files. Make sure to test your changes locally and ensure they are functioning correctly. Commit your changes to the project repository.

Managing Dependencies This project uses npm to manage dependencies. To add or update dependencies:

Use the following command to install a new package: npm install package-name

Use the following command to update an existing package: npm update package-name

Ensure you update the package.json file with the new dependencies and versions.
